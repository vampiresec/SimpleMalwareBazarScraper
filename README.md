# SimpleMalwareBazarScraper

Web scraping is the process of gathering information from the Internet. Even copy-pasting the lyrics of your favorite song is a form of web scraping! However, the words “web scraping” usually refer to a process that involves automation. Some websites don’t like it when automatic scrapers gather their data, while others don’t mind.So I searched over the internet found malware barzar to allowing the scraper.

I  have created two web scrapers on the malware bazar website.
1. **Scraping using api**
2. **Scraping using html**


Both scrapers do the same thing. But scraping with api is more efficient than scraping with html. Even with api method we can able to download malware samples. The output is stored in the csv format.
